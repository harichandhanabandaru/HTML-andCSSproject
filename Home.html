                            <h3>Taj Mahal place </h3>
                            <p>
                            Taj Mahal is the epitome of grandeur and splendour, you cannot fathom the beauty of this white marbled monument 
                            unless you stand in front of it. As you approach Taj Mahal, it gradually becomes known to you that this is no ordinary
                             monument, but a vision come to life! Moved by its beauty and the deep affection of Shah Jahan for Mumtaz, the Nobel 
                             Laureate Rabindranath Tagore called it "a teardrop on the face of eternity". A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is located 
                             on the bank of the Yamuna River and is counted among the most popular heritage monuments in India.
                            <p>
                            Built between 1631 and 1648 AD, the Taj Mahal stands as the finest example of Indo-Islamic architecture, 
                            and is one of the seven wonders of the world. The timeless beauty of the Taj is a reflection of the profound 
                            pain and longing which Shah Jahan was overcome by after the death of Mumtaz Mahal. Today, visitors celebrate,
                            reflect and admire the splendour of the Taj. Inside, both Shah Jahan and Mumtaz lie buried in their graves, 
                            divided in life, but united in death. 
                            </p>
